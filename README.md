# What Is Hepheastus?
Hepheastus is a Multi-Web Application Vulnerability Scanner written in Perl, most of his scans are accurate!

# Incoming Features
We are now scripting a CMS(Content Manager System) detecter! We are also adding a Dork searcher :)

# Important
we are currently working on it, if you have any bugs, issues or suggestions please report in the issues section in Github!

# Any Perl Module Error?
<p>
In some cases Perl may say that you are missing an module if that happens run that:
cpan -i LWP::Simple && cpan -i Getopt::Long && cpan -i Term::ANSIColor
If cpan is missing search on google how to install CPAN in your favorite distribution (Mine is Debian <3)
</p>

# Functions
<p>
Hepheastus can scan for XSS, LFI, RFI and SQL vulnerabilities, he can also spoof your user-agent to make your more anoymous.
Of course more the tool is supported and loved, more we will update it!
